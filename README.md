---------------------------

USAGE:

* Use the items from your inventory and you will recieve an on screen notification as well as a telegram. 
  * Note: only one telegram is saved per user so if you use multiple of an item you will loose other telegrams from yourself.

* Customize what the item will send to the user via telegram and on screen in the config.lua.
* You can change the item names, if you do this make sure to change the names in the main_s.lua.
* You can disable the telegram functionality if you comment out or remove it, this will result in the user having to write down the reciepe. 
* The telegram gives a rudimentary way for the user to refer back to a reciepe. (Telegram is sent by the user to themselves.)
* You can use any item you want and make it intricate like "rare" reciepes only come from graverobbing due to only finding the specific item there etc.

---------------------------

Changing item names in main_s.lua:

BEFORE: 
```
VorpInv.RegisterUsableItem("book1", function(data)

    VorpInv.subItem(data.source, "book1", 1)
    local Character = VorpCore.getUser(data.source).getUsedCharacter
    local sender1 = Character.firstname 
    local sender2 = Character.lastname
    TriggerClientEvent('warp_info:Vulture', data.source, sender1, sender2)
end)
```

AFTER:
```
VorpInv.RegisterUsableItem("newitemname", function(data)

    VorpInv.subItem(data.source, "newitemname", 1)
    local Character = VorpCore.getUser(data.source).getUsedCharacter
    local sender1 = Character.firstname 
    local sender2 = Character.lastname
    TriggerClientEvent('warp_info:Vulture', data.source, sender1, sender2)
end)
```
* "newitemname" should match whatever item you want to use from your database.
