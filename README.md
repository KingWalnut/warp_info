USAGE:

*Use the items from your inventory and you will recieve an on screen notification as well as a telegram. 
  *Note: only one telegram is saved per user so if you use multiple of an item you will loose other telegrams from yourself.

*Customize what the item will send to the user via telegram and on screen in the config.lua.
*You can change the item names, if you do this make sure to change the names in the main_s.lua.
*You can disable the telegram functionality if you comment out or remove it, this will result in the user having to write down the reciepe. 
*The telegram gives a rudimentary way for the user to refer back to a reciepe. (Telegram is sent by the user to themselves.)
