Change Log:

Latest Version:

	Added cooldown time in Config.CoolDownTime.  Default is set to 30 sec, set to 0 to turn off cooldown.
	Added Config.MustUseVoice in config as well.  This will make it so the player has to use ingame voice to activate the mugging.
	( I want to add a timeout in this so if you do not hit E or Use voice to start the mugging after a certain time the ped will run away but need find the best solution to get this coded in.  Hopefully next update will have this added)
	
Previous Fix:
	
	Added check to see if ped is fleeing - no more stopping NPC from full sprint.
	Removed the abality to mug NPC from inside vehicle.
	Changed the check for target running away - check for target distance. ( no more mugging and running away from NPC and still getting cash)
	Added support for BlackMoney in Config.   Just set  Config.DirtyMoney = true   and will payout only BlackMoney.
	Fixed error that was showing up on server script for expected then near =
	Removed the function to mug animals (funny but unintentional)
	Added check for player so you can not mug other players on the server.
	Added Police Requirement in Config
	Added progressBar support in Config if set to false you do not have to have progressBar installed.
	Moved Giveable items to the Config for easier adjusting for server owners.
	Fixed ESX.jobname not noticing new job until restart - thanks to XxFri3ndlyxX
	Removed Mugging MissionEntityPeds so servers with doctors or clerks stationed around town dont need to worry about them.

Features:

	Can Mug any local you are with-in 5.0m
 	Will receive random amount from Config.MinMoney to  Config.MaxMoney -  default is 5 - 100
	Can set Police Notify Percentage - default is set to 40%
	Can set Always Notify on death -  This will always notify Police of Murder if NPC is killed during mugging.  Once they start running the script will not notify if you kill them.
	Must have Weapon that is not from melee/explosive catagory to start a mugging.
	If you aim at a vehicle that is moving at all (even being pushed) the NPC will ignore the mugging script and act as the game dictates.
	If you aim at a driver of a stopped vehicle the driver will exit the vehicle and put hands up you can then start the mugging.
	Player can stop same NPC but if that npc is last one mugged will not be able to mug again.
	Police Notification gives Alert as well as Circle that will slowly vanish over time (default is 250 seconds - not in Config.lua with this version)
  


This is my first Scrpt for FiveM using Lua. I am sure someone with more experience can trim down the code to make it more streamlined.
I have tested this on a local hosted ESX server as well as a server that I play on. 

I have updated to add config.lua for easier management on a server.  Tried to include the giveableItems list in the config but kept getting a error on trying to pull random item from list in config.  Will look into adding items list in config next update.  For now you will have to change the list at the very top of  main_c.lua to items that are on your server.  

If anyone has any questions feel free to send me message
